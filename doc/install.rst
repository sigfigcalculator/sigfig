Installation
============

Automatic Install
-----------------

To install the :mod:`sigfig` module, simply run this command in your terminal of choice:
::

    $ pip install sigfig

If you don't have pip installed, `the pip install page <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/>`_
can guide you through the process.  However if your version of Python doesn't come with pip consider updating your Python to the `latest version <https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/>`_.

Manual Install
--------------

Alternatively, you can :download:`download sigfig.py <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drakegroup/sigfig/master/sigfig/sigfig.py>` and extract it to either your Python Scripts directory or the same directory as the file from which you're using :mod:`sigfig`.
You will need to do the same for the `sortedcontainers module <https://pypi.org/project/sortedcontainers/>`_ - a dependency for this project.
